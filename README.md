This project develops a system for automatically categorizing scientific research articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP). 
It includes:

* **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing article text for analysis.
* **Feature Extraction:** Utilizing TF-IDF to convert text into numerical representations.
* **Model Training:** Implementing Multinomial Naive Bayes and LSTM models for classification.
* **Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices.

This project provides a practical example of applying NLP techniques to classify scientific literature, offering insights into data preprocessing and model selection for text categorization tasks.
